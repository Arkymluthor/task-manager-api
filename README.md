# task-manager-api

Welcome to my task-manager.

It is a project with inputs from my Udemy class.

The App can be signed on to for maintaining tasks for different users.

Input data are stored using the MongoDB database.

A major componet of this work is the user authentication and multiple device access.

The app was deployed on heroku. Take a peep below
